For CPSC 353 SONGMATCH / MusicString / a name we all agree on
5/9/2019

Create and acquire Google API access tokens for Youtube/maybe Apple music once I get some money (currently it is 99$). Soundcloud
is unavailable sadly. Rhapsody/ another streaming service is perhaps necessary.
2=GUI or WEBSITE?! We can't agree and need a team meeting.

Update 4/29/19:
Website would be the move, as mounting Java upon HTML is easier than a python server. However the API of both Spotify and Youtube seem to favour Python, and make traversing and combining searches harder. 
So far I have gotten Youtube as a "readonly" file on http://localhost:8000/CDSTrial.html . I don't think I have the skill currently to create a playlist of X songs based on a string input. Nor am I sure how we will combine spotify WITH Youtube.
