CPSC 353 Submission # 4

For the last submission, I worked on obtaining and/or writing all the functions necessary for using the Spotify API. Most of the functions I did not write myself;
however, all the functions attach to the Spotify API and then preform searches as well as adding to the playlist if implemented correctly. The functions only are
able to search for artists and songs, but that information should be enough to get the output that we wanted. If I were able to better understand how JavaScript
really works and functions I think I would better able to implement into the program we had in mind. The main program that has all the functionality is the
spotify_scripts.js if you wanted to see all the functions that I obtained.
