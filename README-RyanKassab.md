CPSC 353 Submission # 2
Dr. Fahy
14 April 2019

For the second submission, I was the one to get the Spotify API key, and some of the starter code.
The main code that is there is just the searching code for how to search for an artist/song,
which is a big part of our project.

For the third submission I will be working more on the Spotify aspect of this project, so 
anything having to do with connecting to the API and doing anything with it.
