CPSC 353 Submission #3

For the second submission I updated the index.html file to display videos from Youtube. As of submitting this I do not know our Youtube API key, so hopefully I will recieve that from one of my group members to test out the code. The feature is pretty easy to use. Just like a normal search bar, you input the videos you want to see with a keyword, and videos matching that keyword are displayed.
