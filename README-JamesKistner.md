For the final submission I looked into paring the youtube search functionality with a button on the webstie I created. First I became a google developer to recieve an API key. I spent a lot of time watching tutorials and looking at code examples, but I couldn't get the function to work. So, unfortunately the search functionality that I set out to implement doesn't work properly. However, I submitted an index.html file that shows the work I did.
