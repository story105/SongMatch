### Submission #2
14 April 2019

For the second submission, I researched on the Spotify API and gotten some reference projects we could use for our project. 
* Official Documentation: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/
  * https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/libraries/
* Spotify API in Python: https://github.com/plamere/spotipy
  * a Test repository for Spotify's audio analysis features using Spotipy, we might be able to use to implement our own "discover music" feature: https://github.com/ereeq/SpotifyML
  * Spotipy documentation: https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

For the third submission I will be working more on the analysis and song match algorithm part of the project. 

### Submission #3
29 April 2019

For this third submission, I worked on the project submission report. I looked through everyone's contributions and attempted to figure out shortcomings and features that we successfully worked on.

We are still in the process of song-search and a full API implementation, so my proposed analysis feature is postponed. 

### Final Submission
9 May 2019

For the final submisison, I looked into converting a spotify search into a youtube search. There was no separate Youtube Music API so I had to use Relevance search with "title + artist name". It's quite a simple conversion code, but none of the other API features were implemented due to technical difficulties.
