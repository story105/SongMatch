Eric Lim CPSC 353 Submission #2
Dr. Fahy 14 April 2019

For the second submission, I researched on the Spotify API and gotten some reference projects we could use for our project. 
* Official Documentation: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/
  * https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/libraries/
* Spotify API in Python: https://github.com/plamere/spotipy
  * a Test repository for Spotify's audio analysis features using Spotipy, we might be able to use to implement our own "discover music" feature: https://github.com/ereeq/SpotifyML
  * Spotipy documentation: https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

For the third submission I will be working more on the analysis and song match algorithm part of the project.
