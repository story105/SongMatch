Dr. Fahy
14 April 2019

*For the second submission of the project I worked on the Soundcloud API. I also began a program to get credentials/info from Soundcloud.

*For the third submission I will be working to search the libraries of Soundcloud and Spotify with/without log in credentials. I want to begin integrating the API's together.
